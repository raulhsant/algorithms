//Problem Statement
//You're given strings J representing the types of stones that are jewels,
//Yand S representing the stones you have.  Each character in S is a type of
//Ystone you have.  You want to know how many of the stones you have are also jewels.
/*
The letters in J are guaranteed distinct, and all characters in J and S are
letters. Letters are case sensitive, so "a" is considered a different type of stone from "A". */
